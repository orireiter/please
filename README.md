# Please

simple command line


Left To Dos:
0. maybe create a managing class that's repsponsible for everything and listens and acts, and the main just creates it and starts running it?✅
1. show git branch if the current folder is a repository.
2. create maybe a managing class that returns the dir path alongside more info such as the git repo and all that.
3. maybe do a switch case or something that acts upon special chars such as tab, enter etc.✅
4. support tab to check what other completetion the command has.
5. support up/down arrow to browse through command history, while filtering by the input already given. for example if a user wrote "ech" the browse only through the command history with this prefix.
6. add colors to make this better?
7. allow adding configuration so users decide which features to use?
8. allow using left/right arrows to move cursor in the text written, then add stuff like (alt/ctrl/shift) + arrows.
